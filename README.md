## :speech_balloon: What...

Cloud Entities is a collection of 234 special characters encoded in 6 different languages (plain symbol, html, css, numeric, hex and octal).

Easy to use, you can copy what you need just one click.
You can also find in the code source a javascript list of literal object of all these characters.

## ðŸ¤” Why !?

Do you know witch hexadecimal value you need to encode a slash *(/)*? `\57`<br>
Do you Know how to encode the angled quotation mark for you before/after ::speudo-element in css *(Â«)*? `\00ab`<br>
Do you know the HTML entitie for a pilcrow *(Â¶)*? `&para;`
> If you do, watch out! You may be a cyborg and you don't know yet. *Checkout for serial number tattoo*.

Personally, I don't. I can't remember them all. So I've create an handy way to retrieve them quickly.<br>
